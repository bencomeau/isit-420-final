# isit-420-final

## Proposed breakdown

Below is what I'm proposing for the division of work.

Ben will create:
- The PIG scripts which use the data sources to create output files
- Create the SQL DB and tables (this may already be done?)
- Using the above output files, populate the SQL tables.
- A LINQ query

Brandon will create:
> Note: we can likely just clone the latest ASP.NET homework (see resources links below) which should save a ton of work.
- The ASP.NET project which includes:
  - The front end (assuming vanilla JS but totally up to you)
  - The API and related endpoints (3 endpoints, 1 for each query...the cloned project should already have this)
  - 2 LINQ queries (which ones would you like to do? I'll do the one you don't pick.)

Together we will create:
- The PPT

## Outstanding items
- We need to figure out what input the user should be able to enter for the queries. Per the homework, it can't just be three canned queries.
- Does Brandon have the SQL tables already created? Or was it just the diagram?

## Resources

As a reminder, below are some of the resources we have.

- https://github.com/bencomeau/isit-420-hw6 has the tables, structure, and queries.
- https://github.com/bencomeau/isit-420-homework-four is the link to the latest ASP.NET homework which might be a good project to clone?
